      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.thenorthface.com/" target="blank">
          The North Face
        </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        The North Face website stands out for its clean layout, strong product imagery, and consistent branding. It feels modern, straightforward, and user-friendly.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Contrast:</strong> Their bold product images pop against a predominantly white or light-gray background, making text and calls-to-action easy to spot.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Repetition:</strong> Fonts, colors, and button styles are consistent across each page. Navigation elements and headlines all share the same design language.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Alignment:</strong> Content grids are aligned neatly, keeping product listings and promotional banners clean and organized. Headings and text blocks follow a clear left or center alignment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Proximity:</strong> Related information (like product descriptions, pricing, and “Add to Cart” buttons) is grouped together, making it easy for users to find what they need without excessive scrolling.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://arngren.net/" target="blank">
          Arngren
        </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Arngren is a classic example of chaotic web design, with jumbled images, mismatched color palettes, and an overwhelming amount of text scattered all over the page.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Contrast:</strong> The site bombards visitors with clashing colors, bright GIFs, and uncoordinated images, so text often competes visually with background elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Repetition:</strong> It lacks a consistent style-fonts, colors, and layout elements vary wildly from one section to the next.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Alignment:</strong> Content boxes, images, and text appear randomly placed, so there is little sense of a structured grid or purposeful layout.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Proximity:</strong> Elements that belong together (like products, pricing, and descriptions) are scattered in different places, forcing users to hunt around.
        </li>
